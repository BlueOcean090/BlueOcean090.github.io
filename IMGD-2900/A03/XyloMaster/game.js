1: Changed status color to say "CLick Grid"
2: Moving mouse outside of grid resets all the grid colors
3: Click sound replaced wist random Xylophone sound
4: Cursor is redundancy with a "~" on the selected block
5: Random Colored for the clicked block

PS.init( system, options )
Called once after engine is initialized but before event-polling begins.
This function doesn't have to do anything, although initializing the grid dimensions with PS.gridSize() is recommended.
If PS.grid() is not called, the default grid dimensions (8 x 8 beads) are applied.
Any value returned is ignored.
[system : Object] = A JavaScript object containing engine and host platform information properties; see API documentation for details.
[options : Object] = A JavaScript object with optional data properties; see API documentation for details.
